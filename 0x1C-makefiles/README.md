# C - Makefiles

A Makefile is a configuration file used  to manage the build process of a software project. Makefiles are used with the "make" utility, which is a build automation tool. The primary purpose of a Makefile is to specify how the source code for a project should be compiled and linked to produce the final executable or library. It also defines dependencies between different parts of the project, so that when a source file is modified, only the necessary parts of the project are recompiled.

A typical Makefile consists of rules and dependencies. Each rule specifies a target (usually a file to be generated), dependencies (the files that the target depends on), and the commands to be executed to generate the target from its dependencies.
